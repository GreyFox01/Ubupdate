# Ubupdate
A simple update script for Ubuntu and friends. For those using apt, snap, and flatpack, this script searches for updates and applies them.
Firmware is also scanned and enumerated, with fwupdate being called to search for any updates.
Finally, purge is called to clean up the mess.
Let me know how to make this cript better.
